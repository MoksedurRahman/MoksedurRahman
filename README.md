## 🔧 Projects

Here are a few highlighted projects:

- 🚗 [**Fuel Efficiency Analysis and Visualization using Python**](https://github.com/MoksedurRahman/fuel-consumption-analysis)  
  This project analyzes the FuelConsumption.csv dataset to explore how engine size, cylinders, and fuel consumption affect CO2 emissions. It includes data cleaning, visualizations, and a regression model to predict emissions using Python.

- 📊 [**Heart_Disease_Classification**](https://github.com/MoksedurRahman/heart_disease_classification)  
  To build and evaluate classification models that can accurately predict the likelihood of heart disease using structured health data, enabling better preventive healthcare decisions.

- 📚 [**Data-Sructures-Algorithms-Python**](https://github.com/MoksedurRahman/data-structures-algorithms-python.git)  
  curated collection of data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving techniques using Python. This repository is part of my learning and preparation journey for coding interviews and competitive programming.
